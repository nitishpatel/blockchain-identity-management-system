Next, use the ipo applications to interact with the deployed ipo contract.

JavaScript:

  Start by changing into the "client-javascript" directory:
    cd client-javascript

  Next, install all required packages:
    npm install

  Then run the following applications to enroll the admin user, and register a new user
  called appUser which will be used by the other applications to interact with the deployed
  FabCar contract:
    node enrollAdmin
    node registerUser {userName}

  You can run the invoke application as follows. 
    node invoke

  You can run the query application as follows. By default, the query application will
  return all the shares, but you can update the application to evaluate other transactions:
    node query {userName}
